Lives - Android LiveData Extensions for Kotlin and Java
-------------------------------------------------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adibfara/Lives.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adibfara/Lives) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/bintray/v/adibfara/lives/lives.svg?label=version)](https://github.com/adibfara/Lives)

Add RxJava-like operators to your LiveData objects with ease, usable in Kotlin (as extension functions) and Java (as static functions to a class called Lives)

Download
--------
Add the dependencies to your project:

__AndroidX Version__

```groovy
implementation 'com.snakydesign.livedataextensions:lives:1.3.0'
implementation 'android.arch.lifecycle:extensions:x.x.x' // If you are using the AndroidX version, that's fine too, as the Jetifier will take care of the conversion.
```

__Non AndroidX Version__

```groovy
implementation 'com.snakydesign.livedataextensions:lives:1.2.1'
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata:x.x.x' 
```


If you want to use this library on a Java project, add the following dependency:
```groovy
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:x.x.x'
```

Usage
--------

#### Kotlin
**Import the functions**
```kotlin
    import com.snakydesign.livedataextensions.*
```
**Creating LiveData**

- `liveDataOf` : Create a LiveData object from a value (like `just` in RxJava, although it immediately emits the value)
```kotlin
    val liveData = liveDataOf(2) //liveData will produce 2 (as Int) when observed
```

- `from` : Creates a LiveData that emits the value that the `callable` function produces, and immediately emits it.
```kotlin
    val liveData = liveDataOf {computePI()}
```

- `emptyLiveData` : Creates an empty LiveData
```kotlin
    val liveData = emptyLiveData<Int>()
```


**Filtering**

- `distinct` : Emits the items that are different from all the values that have been emitted so far
```kotlin
    val originalLiveData = MutableLiveData<Int>()
    val newLiveData = originalLiveData.distinct()
    originalLiveData.value = 2
    originalLiveData.value = 2 // newLiveData will not produce this
    originalLiveData.value = 3 // newLiveData will produce
    originalLiveData.value = 2 // newLiveData will not produce this
```

- `distinctUntilChanged` : Emits the items that are different from the last item
```kotlin
    val originalLiveData = MutableLiveData<Int>()
    val newLiveData = originalLiveData.distinctUntilChanged()
    originalLiveData.value = 2
    originalLiveData.value = 2 // newLiveData will not produce this
    originalLiveData.value = 3 // newLiveData will produce
    originalLiveData.value = 2 // newLiveData will produce
```

- `filter` :Emits the items that pass through the predicate
```kotlin
    val originalLiveData = MutableLiveData<Int>()
    val newLiveData = originalLiveData.filter { it > 2 }
    originalLiveData.value = 3 // newLiveData will produce
    originalLiveData.value = 2 // newLiveData will not produce this
```

- `first()` : produces a SingleLiveData that produces only one Item.
- `take(n:Int)` : produces a LiveData that produces only the first n Items.
- `takeUntil(predicate)` : Takes until a certain predicate is met, and does not emit anything after that, whatever the value.
- `skip(n)` : Skips the first n values.
- `skipUntil(predicate)` : Skips all values until a certain predicate is met (the item that actives the predicate is also emitted).
- `elementAt(index)` : emits the item that was emitted at `index` position
- `nonNull()` : Will never emit the nulls to the observers (outputs a `NonNullLiveData`).
- `defaultIfNull(value)`: Will produce the `value` when `null` is received.

**Combining**

- `merge(List<LiveData>)` : Merges multiple LiveData, and emits any item that was emitted by any of them
- `LiveData.merge(LiveData)` : Merges this LiveData with another one, and emits any item that was emitted by any of them
- `concat(LiveData...)` : Concats multiple LiveData objects (and converts them to `SingleLiveData` if necessary, and emits their first item in order. (Please check the note below.)
- `LiveData.then(LiveData)` : Concats the first LiveData with the given one. (Please check the note below.)
- `startWith(startingValue)`: Emits the `startingValue` before any other value.
- `zip(firstLiveData, secondLiveData, zipFunction)`: zips both of the LiveDatas using the zipFunction and emits a value after both of them have emitted their values, after that, emits values whenever any of them emits a value.
- `combineLatest(firstLiveData, secondLiveData, combineFunction)`: combines both of the LiveDatas using the combineFunction and emits a value after any of them have emitted a value.
- `LiveData.sampleWith(otherLiveData)`: Samples the current live data with other live data, resulting in a live data that emits the last value emitted by the original live data (if any) whenever the other live data emits

**Transforming**

- `map(mapperFunction)` : Map each value emitted to another value (and type) with the given function
- `switchMap(mapperFunction)` : Maps any values that were emitted by the LiveData to the given function that produces another LiveData
- `doBeforeNext(OnNextAction)` : Does the `onNext` function before everything actually emitting the item to the observers
- `doAfterNext(OnNextAction)` : Does the `onNext` function after emitting the item to the observers(function) : Does the `onNext` function before everything actually emitting the item to the observers
- `buffer(count)` : Buffers the items emitted by the LiveData, and emits them when they reach the `count` as a List.
- `scan(accumulator)` : Applies the accumulator function to each emitted item, starting with the second emitted item. Initial value of the accumulator is the first item.
- `scan(seed, accumulator)` : Applies the accumulator function to each emitted item, starting with the initial seed.
- `amb(LiveData...)` : Emits the items of the first LiveData that emits the item. Items of other LiveDatas will never be emitted and are not considered.
- `toMutableLiveData()` : Converts a LiveData to a MutableLiveData with the initial value set by this LiveData's value

#### Java

You can call any function prefixed with `Lives` keyword.

    import com.snakydesign.livedataextensions.Lives;

 - Example (create a LiveData with the initial value of 2 and map each value to its String type
    ```kotlin
    LiveData<String> liveData = Lives.map(Lives.just(2), new Function1<Integer, String>() {
                @Override
                public Integer invoke(Integer integer) {
                    return String.valueOf(integer);
                }
            }) ;
    ```

#### Notes

Please note that because of design of `LiveData`, after a value is emitted to an observer, and then another value is emitted, the old value is destroyed in any LiveData object. So unlike RxJava, if a new Observer is attached, It will only receive the most recent value.

So If you want to use operators like `concat`, you have to consider allowing only one observer to the LiveData.

PRs are more than welcome, and please file an issue If you encounter something üçª.
